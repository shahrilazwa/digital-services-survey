## Models and Functions

Each model represents a database table and contains various functions that facilitate database interactions. Below are the key models with detailed descriptions of their functions:

### **User.php**

The `User` model represents users of the system and manages authentication, roles, and related relationships.

- `roles()`: Defines a many-to-many relationship with roles, allowing users to have multiple roles.
- `organization()`: Defines a `belongsTo` relationship with organizations, linking each user to a specific organization.
- `surveys()`: Defines a `hasMany` relationship with `SurveySchema`, linking users with the surveys they created.
- `logs()`: Retrieves user-related activity logs for auditing purposes.

### **Role.php**

Manages user roles and permissions within the system.

- `permissions()`: Establishes a many-to-many relationship with permissions.
- `users()`: Retrieves all users assigned to a specific role.

### **Permission.php**

Defines system-wide permissions.

- `roles()`: Retrieves roles that have been assigned a specific permission.

### **SurveySchema.php**

Represents the structure of a survey and its associated questions.

- `questions()`: Establishes a `hasMany` relationship with `SurveyQuestion`.
- `responses()`: Retrieves responses submitted for the survey.
- `creator()`: Links the survey to the user who created it.

### **SurveyQuestion.php**

Handles individual survey questions and their related responses.

- `survey()`: Defines a `belongsTo` relationship with `SurveySchema`.
- `responses()`: Retrieves responses related to a specific question.

### **SurveyResult.php**

Stores user responses to surveys.

- `user()`: Defines a `belongsTo` relationship with `User`, linking responses to the respondent.
- `details()`: Establishes a `hasMany` relationship with `SurveyResultDetail`.
- `survey()`: Links each response to a specific survey.

### **SurveyResultDetail.php**

Stores detailed responses to survey questions.

- `survey_result()`: Defines a `belongsTo` relationship with `SurveyResult`.
- `question()`: Retrieves the associated survey question.

### **Organization.php**

Represents organizations linked to surveys and users.

- `users()`: Retrieves all users linked to the organization.
- `surveys()`: Fetches all surveys associated with the organization.

### **Agency.php**

Handles government agencies linked to surveys.

- `surveys()`: Fetches all surveys managed by the agency.
